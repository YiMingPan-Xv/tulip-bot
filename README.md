# Tulip Bot - A personal discord bot with currency system

Tulip Bot is a simple but powerful discord bot that implements a fun and interactive currency system.

## Features

The tulip bot manages the economy of the discord guild, and provides several minigames to earn currency or gamble it.

The currency used is "Flower", and can be used to benefit from purchaseable items, roles and more (WIP).

There are several ways to earn Flowers:

- Work: Earn some Flowers every 5 minutes.

- Breach: Gain some Flowers after typing in a password. Watch out, other users might claim it before you!

- Steal: Steal some Flowers from another user. Beware, victims might accuse you for stealing!

- Accuse: You can accuse someone of stealing from you. If you guess right, take back what they have stolen, plus an extra!

- Bets: Bet your flowers in many minigames! Take your chances at the roulette, blackjack, coin flips, and raffles!

- Gifts: If someone is feeling generous, they can give some Flowers to you!
